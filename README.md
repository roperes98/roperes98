As a React JS developer with over 3 years of experience, I am skilled in building scalable and performant web applications using the latest front-end technologies. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software and have studied complementary technologies like React Native and Node JS. 

I am passionate about constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry, and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and improve as a developer. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong team player and communicator, with the ability to work well with others to solve complex problems and deliver successful projects.
